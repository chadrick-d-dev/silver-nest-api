## [Silver Nest Server](https://silver-nest-server.herokuapp.com/api/v1/residents)

This is a backend repository, which was built to house data for our [Silver Nest](https://github.com/cameronRomo/silver-nest) frontend application.

### Context

We decided to take on a project idea, which is intended to solve an issue regarding housing and experience for college students. In addition, this would also solve the issue for older adults, who wish to age-in-place, or maintain some independence by continuing to live in their own home. The idea is to give students in the college of Health and Human sciences the chance to live with an older adult rent free in exchange for trips to doctor's appointments, help with mobility, medications, and general activities of daily living. The Silver Nest Sever is a data base which enables our application to house data specific to an older adult who wishes to be involved with this program. From here, data is displayed in the app for students to find an older adult with needs they feel most suited to assist with.
